1. Write a function which takes a list of integers and its length and returns the sum of all the prime numbers in the list.

Example:

int x[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
int s = sum_primes(x, 10)

s == 17

2. Write a function which takes an unsigned integer and returns the sum of all the factors of the number.

Example:

int s = sum_factors(10)
s == 18   // 1 + 2 + 5 + 10

3. Write a function which takes an unsigned integer and returns the sum of all the digits in the number.

Example:

int s = sum_digits(1278)
s == 18   // 1 + 2 + 7 + 8

Hint: Use the % and / operators to extract digits from the number.

4. Write a function which takes an array of strings, length of the array and draws a histogram of the frequency of the characters in the strings.

Example:

char *x[3] = {"hello", "world", "hello"}
draw_histogram(x, 3)

h: **
e: **
l: *****
o: ***
w: *
r: *
d: *

Note that we the histogram is case sensitive so 'h' and 'H' count as different characters.

5. Write a function which takes a string and returns the number of words in the string. Assume 
that there is always one space separating the words and there are no spaces at the begining 
or the end of the string.

Example:

int s = count_words("hello world, how are you?")
s == 5

Empty string should return a count of 0.

int s = count_words("")
s == 0
