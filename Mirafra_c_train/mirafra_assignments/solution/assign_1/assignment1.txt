4. Extract fields from a encoded integer

An instruction is encoded with the following format:

opcode: 4 bits
output reg: 4 bits
operand 1 reg: 4 bits
operand 2 reg: 4 bits
memory address: 16 bits

Write a function that takes an instruction (int) as an argument and prints various fields in hex. 
The output should look like:
OPCODE: 0x3
OUTPUT REG: 0x4
OPERAND 1 REG: 0x5
OPERAND 2 REG: 0x6
MEMORY ADDRESS: 0x1234

5. print_case

Write a function that takes a character as an argument and prints "lower case" if the character
is a lower case letter and "upper case" if the character is an upper case letter. If the character
is not a letter, the function should print "not a letter".

6. to_upper

Write a function to_upper to convert lower case letter to upper case letter. If the input 
is not a lower case letter, the function should return the input as is.

7. fizzbuzz

Write a function which takes a number and goes over numbers from 1 to 'n' and prints "Fizz" if 
the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5, "FizzBuzz" if the number
