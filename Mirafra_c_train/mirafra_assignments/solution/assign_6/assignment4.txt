1. Implement and test stack of integers using array. It should support the following interface.

void push(int x); // push an integer x onto the stack
int pop(); // remove the top element from the stack and return it
int is_empty(); // return 1 if the stack is empty, 0 otherwise
int is_full(); // return 1 if the stack is full, 0 otherwise
void print(); // print the elements of the stack

Test the stack implementation by pushing 10 integers onto the stack, then popping 5 integers from the stack, 
and then pushing 5 more integers onto the stack. Print the elements of the stack after each operation.


2. print_histogram_of_integers

Write a function print_histogram_of_integers that takes an array of integers and its size as input and prints a histogram of the integer frequencies. 
You can assume that that there will be at the most 20 unique integers in the array.

Example:

int arrray = {7, 19, 3, 7, 3, 7, 3, 7, 19, 7, 3, 19, 19, 19, 19, 19, 7, 7, 7, 7};

print_histogram_of_integers(arrray, 20);

should print:

7: *********
19: *******
3: ****
